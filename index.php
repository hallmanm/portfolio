      <p class="rec">"Michael joined AEO as a frontend developer, working on websets late into the night with our scrappy development team at the time. Since then, Michael has grown into a leader and become a champion for optimization in the webset space as a key player in our Content Strategy team. He was highly influential most recently in leading content architecture with Contentstack, developing a foundation hands-on for our solution to grow and scale for all shopping channels. He has also been a passionate leader in the A/B testing and experimentation area, pioneering efforts to mature our capabilities and integrations through Tealium, Google Optimize, and this year with our switch to Optimizely. Michael was always a strong advocate for his team and the work to better the experiences for our AEO customer."</p>
